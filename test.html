## Focus Areas
– Tokenization and embeddings
– Transformer architecture (attention, self-attention)
– Pre-training on vast corpora
– Fine-tuning for specific tasks
– Inference and prompting techniques
– Safety and bias mitigation

## Approach
– Train on internet-scale data to learn grammar, facts, and reasoning
– Use attention mechanisms to understand context and relationships
– Generate responses one token at a time, predicting what comes next
– Apply prompt engineering to guide behavior
– Continuously evaluate with human feedback and benchmark tasks

## Output
– Coherent, context-aware text completions
– Answers, summaries, translations, and code
– Embeddings for semantic search and classification
– Chat interfaces and API integrations

Focus on clarity, safety, and usefulness. Support with examples and citations when possible.
